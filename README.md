FOR USER:

Open CSV file and .py code in Python and run 

SOURCES: 

-some aspects of the dict.update code used in the PyPoll assignment and f.write code in the PyBank code were sourced from Stack Overflow and W3Schools

-the "os.chdir(os.path.dirname(os.path.realpath(__file__)))" code was given to me by my tutor Kourt Bailey

-i consulted the AskBSC Learning Assistant for guidance on the PyPoll project, specifically with the dictionary formatting and printing
